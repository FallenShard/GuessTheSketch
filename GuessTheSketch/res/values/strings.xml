    <!-- Tutorial -->
    <string name="tutorial_basic_1">
        Welcome to GUESS THE SKETCH application! This short guide will explain
        the basic flow of the game and its rules.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_2">
        As you start the game from the main menu, you will be presented with
        two options: to start the game on this device or to start a game through
        Bluetooth with a nearby device.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_3">
        Before the actual game starts, you\'ll need
        to enter team names for the current game. Colors of the text will also
        represent that team\'s turn by coloring UI elements with corresponding
        color. There are two teams competing in total, with blue starting first.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_4">
        The game consists of alternating phases of drawing and guessing a word.
        One member of the team draws a word, while the other one tries to guess it.
        The game ends depending on the game mode that you selected, either by 
        fixed rounds, points or time. Drawing and guessing each last 60 seconds.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_5">
        Before you can start your drawing masterpiece,
        you\'ll need to select a word. Words are arranged from easiest to hardest,
        with the easiest one being worth 5 points and the hardest one 20 points. Numbers
        next to the words are multipliers that will be used to further evaluate guessed word.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_6">
        During the drawing phase, use the color palette and brush sizes at your
        disposal. You may also undo your moves and finish before the timer runs out.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_7">
        Once the drawing is over, the game will switch over to the guessing phase,
        where you\'ll be required to guess the current word, with the game drawing
        the word on canvas, just as your team mate had done.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_8">
        If you entered the correct word, the timer will stop and your team will 
        get appropriate amount of points. A dialog will pop that shows the current 
        score and it will allow you to hand over the device to the other team.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_basic_9">
        The phases repeat until the game has reached a game ending condition,
        as selected in the configuration phase. Good luck and have fun!
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_advanced_1">
        The formula for calculating the points is as follows: 
        \n(WordPoints + SecondsLeftFromDrawing / 10 + SecondsLeftFromGuessing / 10) * WordModifier
        \nwhere the WordPoints take values of 5, 10, 15 and 20, extra points on seconds
        are rounded down and WordModifier is a value between 1.0 and 2.0.
        \nOver Bluetooth, the formula is
        \n(WordPoints + 2 * SecondsLeftFromGuessing / 10) * WordModifier,
        as the guessing and drawing happen simultaneously.
    </string>
